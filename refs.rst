Feature engeneering and selection
---------------------------------

Basic methods:

* Recursive feature ellimination based on cross-validation/score
  





Generating pseudo-absence points 
--------------------------------

The main methods that are currently 
used to generate pseudo-absence points are (Senait, 2013): 

* randomly generated pseudo-absence locations from background data; 
* pseudo-absence locations generated within a delimited geographical distance from recorded presence points; 
* pseudo-absence locations selected in areas that are environmentally dissimilar from presence points.

* Expert-based approch (random selection from predefined areas selected by an expert)
  isn't mentioned yet!!
